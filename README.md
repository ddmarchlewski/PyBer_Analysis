# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
This project's purpose was to analyze data of Pyber ride sharing data of three different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). By useing Pandas and Matplotlib, we will make a  make multiple line graph that will show total weekly fares of each city type.

## Results 
The data frame below was created during the analysis and it shows total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. 

There are some keyfindings within this data frame:
  1. We can see that rural cities have the lowest amount of total rides, total drivers and total fares.
  2. Urban cites have the highest amount of total rides, total drivers and total fares.
  3. Suburban cites have the 2nd highest amount of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 
  4. Rural cites have highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver even though they had the lowest amount of total rides, drivers, and fares.
  5. Urban cites have the lowest average fare per ride and average far per driver even though they had the highest amount of total rides, drivers, and fares.

A multiple line chart was then created as part of the analysis. This chart visualizes the total fares from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019 for each city type.

## Summary
Overall, the analysis shows what average fares to expect when trying to ride in the different city types and what the fares will look like on a weekly basis. 

### Recommendations
  1. Urban cities can charge more per trip since they are performing the best out of the three city types. 
  2. Since suburban cities are the middle performing city type, I recommend putting more investments towards urban and rural cities.  
  3. Invest in more drivers for rural areas since in seems that there are not enough drivers to meet the demand for rides.
